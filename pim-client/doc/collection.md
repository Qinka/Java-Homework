The PIM is using file, HTTP backend, and the database as the place where store the datas.

For FILE, the default path is `.ignore/data`, and you can use your own one.

For HTTP, the backend is named `pim-be`, and that can be found on the [GitHub](https://github.com/Qinka/pim-be).

For DATABASE, the database is PostgreSQL, and the initial script of the Database can be found in the backend's repo.
